My name is Vincent. I am a computer technology enthusiast. I am a professional software developer and I specialize in C/C++ application development. I am currently living in Japan.

So why DotSlashZero? Just like with any other names, it is just a name for this site. It has no special meaning whatsoever. The "DotSlash" part may be a reference to current directory in Unix-like environments and "Zero" is the number zero. None of that matters though â€“ "DotSlashZero" is just the name of this site.

This site is powered by many open source frameworks. See the source file of any page for details. You do not need to enable JavaScript and cookies for this website to work. The only JavaScript used is Google's font loader engine (to display source code snippets using a monospaced font). This website uses Jekyll to generate static pages so no dynamic contents are ever presented to your browser.
