You know, for testing reasons.

I just started a blog (after thinking about it for so many times). I have been wanting to write some useful thoughts that I had while working as a software developer, so expect technical talks and details. On top of that, I am currently living in Japan. Having lived in Canada for about a decade, almost everything is different and fun for me. I want to share all those experiences to my western friends.

Should there be anything more to say for the first post?

Well, actually, setting up this blog is a little bit challenging for me. I did some website development work while I was on my undergraduate degree and thatâ€™s about my experience with it. Of course, I know the technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), but my knowledge about it is usually just for fixing things (or as many others know it, for duct taping stuff). I was never a visual and design oriented person so please forgive the simplicity of the look and feel of this site (or for the lack of it).

Now that I think about it, I feel that I do not like the current style.

Either way, I will be sharing some stuff from here on out. I will also try my best to improve the look and feel of this site. Cheers!
